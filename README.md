# Recipes (working title)
Ever go to NYT site's Cooking section, browsing through all the beautiful food and site layout, and finding the next perfect dish to whip up... only to get hit with the paywall *one second* after getting to the recipe page? 

Meet Recipes (working title): a recipe catalog - minimally designed, fast, and easy to follow.
